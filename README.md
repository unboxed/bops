## Preflight

### Clone the project

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:unboxed/bops.git
```

## Building the project for local development

### First Time Setup without

#### Install the project's dependencies using bundler and yarn:

```sh
$ bundle install
$ yarn install
```

#### Enable the PostGIS extension:

Within psql's CLI, enable the postgis and postgis_topology extensions:

```sh
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;
```

#### Create the databases

```sh
$ rails db:setup
```

#### Tests

You can run the full test suite using following command:

```sh
$ rspec
```

Individual system specs with opening Chrome browser can be run using the following command:

```sh
$ JS_DRIVER=selenium_chrome rspec spec/system/log_in_spec.rb
```

#### Start the server:

```sh
$ rails server
```

#### Because of the subdomain being enforced, you will need to use Chrome or Firefox to test subdomains (unless you configure your own computer etc file for this to work on any browser):

```
http://southwark.southwark.localhost:3000/
or
http://lambeth.lambeth.localhost:3000/
```
##Dependencies

You will need to install `wkhtmltopdf` locally as this renders the PDF of the decision notice. Install this with the command:

```
brew install --cask wkhtmltopdf
```

##API

API documentation is available at /api-docs/index.html and can be autogenerated by running:

```rake rswag:specs:swaggerize ```

## Creating data through the API

## Working with the bops-applicants front end

When testing bops-applicants emails on localhost, you will need to export the APPLICANTS_APP_HOST variable, with defines the link being sent in emails from bops. Running bops applicants on port 3001 for southwark for ex:

```
export APPLICANTS_APP_HOST=southwark.southwark.localhost:3001
```


## Working with api documentation: aggregate swagger files

We need a single openapi file to exist, but to keep the code easier to maintain we have multiple files that are then compiled into this single file:

```public/api-docs/v1/_build/swagger_doc.yaml```.

So to create a new api endpoint, create your yaml doc inside public/api-docs/v1 and reference it in

``` public/api-docs/v1/swagger_doc.yaml ```

like so:

```
  $ref: "./your_new_file_name.yaml"
```

Make changes to your new file, and when you're happy aggregate them into our single file by installing this package in your machine:

``` npm install -g swagger-cli ```

and running:

```
swagger-cli bundle public/api-docs/v1/swagger_doc.yaml --outfile public/api-docs/v1/_build/swagger_doc.yaml --type yaml
```
