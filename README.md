## Working with api documentation: aggregate swagger files

We need a single openapi file to exist, but to keep the code easier to maintain we have multiple files that are then compiled into this single file:

```public/api-docs/v1/_build/swagger_doc.yaml```.

So to create a new api endpoint, create your yaml doc inside public/api-docs/v1 and reference it in

``` public/api-docs/v1/swagger_doc.yaml ```

like so:

```
  $ref: "./your_new_file_name.yaml"
```

Make changes to your new file, and when you're happy aggregate them into our single file by installing this package in your machine:

``` npm install -g swagger-cli ```

and running:

```
swagger-cli bundle public/api-docs/v1/swagger_doc.yaml --outfile public/api-docs/v1/_build/swagger_doc.yaml --type yaml
```
