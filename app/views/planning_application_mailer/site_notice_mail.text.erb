Dear <%= @planning_application.agent_or_applicant_name %>,

Application number <%= @planning_application.reference_in_full %>

As part of the application process, you must display a site notice  in a public place for 21 days. We have a duty to inform neighbours and other residents about your proposed development and give them the opportunity to comment.

If a site notice is not displayed the Council will not be able to make a decision about your application.

What you need to do

1. Print the site notice
Download the site notice as a printable PDF at <%= @planning_application.site_notice_link %>.

2. Protect the site notice with a waterproof covering
You can use a clear plastic bag or sticky polythene film to protect it from bad weather.

3. Display the site notice
Number of site notices requested: <%= @site_notice.quantity %>

<% if @site_notice.location_instructions.present? %>
Location instructions: <%= @site_notice.location_instructions %>
<% else %>
This must be in a public place at or near the location of your proposed development. It must be visible by people using public roads and footpaths. For example, you could attach the notice to a lamppost or wall outside the property. Make sure the site notice is securely fixed.
<% end -%>

4. Tell us when you put it up
Send an email to <%= @planning_application.user.email %> including:

- a photo showing the location of the site notice
- the date you displayed the site notice
- description of where you put the site notice

Make sure that the text of the site notice is clear in the photo.

You can remove the site notice <%= @planning_application.environment_impact_assessment&.required? ? "30" : "21" %> days from the date you put it up.

If you are not able to print or display the site notice, contact me at <%= @planning_application.user.email %>. This may delay our decision about your application.

Yours

<%= @planning_application.user.name %>
