Dear <%= @planning_application.agent_or_applicant_name %>,

Application number <%= @planning_application.reference_in_full %>

As part of the application process, you must display a site notice  in a public place for 21 days. We have a duty to inform neighbours and other residents about your proposed development and give them the opportunity to comment.

If a site notice is not displayed the Council will not be able to make a decision about your application.

What you need to do

1. Print the site notice 
Download the site notice as a printable PDF at <%= @planning_application.site_notice_link %>.

2. Protect the site notice with a waterproof covering
You can use a clear plastic bag or sticky polythene film to protect it from bad weather.

3. Display the site notice
This must be in a public place at or near the location of your proposed development. It must be visible by people using public roads and footpaths. For example, you could attach the notice to a lamppost or wall outside the property. Make sure the site notice is securely fixed.

4. Tell us when you put it up
Send an email to <%= @planning_application.user.email %> including:

- a photo showing the location of the site notice 
- the date you displayed the site notice
- description of where you put the site notice

Make sure that the text of the site notice is clear in the photo.

You can remove the site notice 21 days from the date you put it up.

If you are not able to print or display the site notice, contact me at <%= @planning_application.user.email %>. This may delay our decision about your application.

Yours 

<%= @planning_application.user.name %>
